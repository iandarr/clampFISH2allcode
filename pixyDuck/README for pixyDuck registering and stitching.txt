pixyDuck is a MATLAB registration and stitching repository written by Ian Dardani
It accepts ND2 files from multiple imaging cycles and resolutions and outputs stitched Tiff files (at native and/or interpolated resolutions; outputting either max merges or stacks). 
Registration is done automatically from the DAPI channel
